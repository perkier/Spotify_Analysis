<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As a playlist hoarder and data science enthusiast, I was always curious to find new ways to discover new songs that could relate to my  own pllaylists or other playlists that I follow.

This project helped me dive deeper on some data analysis problems such as clustering and segmentation and I tried to create automated and interesting ways to visualize the data.

The ultimate goal of this project would be to incorporate Reinforcement Learning with the player in order to give an almost perfect shuffle feature.


### Built With

List of Classes on Processes directory:
* Spotify_Analysis.py - Main script responsible to connect all other classes.
* User.py - Connects with Spotify Web API to get user playlists and performes an analysis of several aspects of each of the playlist's songs. Spotipy was used to facilitate the Spotify Web API integration.
* Data_Pre_Analysis.py - Class used to perform a pre analysis of the data (...).
* Data_Dive.py - More indepth data analysis of selected playlists
