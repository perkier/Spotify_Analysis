<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

List of Classes on Processes directory:
* Spotify_Analysis.py - Main script responsible to connect all other classes.
* User.py - Connects with Spotify Web API to get user playlists and performes an analysis of several aspects of each of the playlist's songs. Spotipy was used to facilitate the Spotify Web API integration.
* Data_Pre_Analysis.py - Class used to perform a pre analysis of the data (...).
* Data_Dive.py - More indepth data analysis of selected playlists

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
